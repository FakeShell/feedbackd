  * data: Lower rumble time for window-close and button-pressed even more.
    Haptic feedback for touchscreen input should be as subtle as possible
    to not make it distracting.
  * data: Add button-released event

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * feedback-sound: Plug a leak.
    We did not free the effect name
  * Doc cleanups
  * feedback-manager: Only act on add.
    We would otherwise ignore the action when no vibra device was yet found.
    Make sure we release the old device when updating.
  * libfeedback: Unset _initted early.
    This make sure a client does not end up in our shutdown phase and sees a
    half initted library.
  * libfeedback: Cancel all running feedbacks on uninit.
    We keep track of the active ids and end them on uninit. This
    make sure feedbacks don't continue to run if the application quits
    and forgets to end a feedback.
  * fbcli: Quit main loop on CTRL-C / SIGTERM.
    This makes sure we invoke the cleanup function correctly and allows
    to test running event handling.
  * docs: Add manpages (Closes: #12)
  * data: Drop phone-missed-call in 'quiet' profile.  Only want LEDs there.
  * feedbackd: Add helper to set up permissions for LEDs.
    This helper knows about the tiggers and necessary permission.
    It's intended to be run via udev.
  * debian: Setup leds via udev.
    This allows feedbackd to set periodic feedback and makes usable
    LED devices identifiable by feedbackd.
  * feedbackd: Support visual feedback via LEDs.
    later on by using the 'repeat' attribute of the LED pattern
    trigger.
  * data: Use LED feedback for missed calls, IMs and SMS
  * Add generic missed notification.
    This can be used e.g. by the shell for general purpose notifictions
    but also for in app notifications of the foreground app.
  * feedback-manager: Add hint to select feedback profile per event.
    This e.g. allows events that are meant for haptic only to avoid
    emitting a sound by omitting the 'full' level and using "quiet"
    instead. (Closes: #7)
  * LfbEvent: Add feedback-profile property.
    This allows to specify the feedback profile to use for
    this particular event.
  * cli: Allow to set profile per event.
    We allowed set the global profile via `-P` use it as per event
    profile when used with `-E`.

feedbackd (0.0.0+git20200527) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Rasmus Thomsen ]
  * build: add proper dependencies on gdbus-codgen-generated headers.
    Without this it was possible that ninja built a target that needs
    the generated header before the header was generated

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Release another git snapshot
  * Honor sound theme on GNOME.
    We don't set this for other DEs since they might want to pick a good
    default from elsewhere.

feedbackd (0.0.0+git20200420) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Release another git snapshot
  * Add symbols file
  * theme: order feedbacks alphabetically.
  * theme: Add feedbacks for window-close and button-press
  * Allow to lower the feedback level per application.

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * d/control: customize short descriptions per binary package
  * d/control: change feedbackd-common architecture to 'all'
  * debian: rename gir package to match typelib name

feedbackd (0.0.0+git20200305) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  * feedbackd-common: Add proper Breaks/Replaces.
    This handles partial upgrades with newer schema but old feebackd.

feedbackd (0.0.0+git20200304) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * libfeedback: Drop trailing semicolon.
    Trips up some compilers.
    Thanks to Andrea Schaefer
  * build: Don't add lfb-enums.c to list of generated sources.
    Otherwise when used as a subproject the master project will try
    to rebuild with it's own set of flags. These lack
    LIBFEEDBACK_COMPILATION which does not end well.
  * Fix typos
  * theme: Add timeout-completed event for alarms and stop watches
  * Update docs (Closes: #4, #8)
  * debian: Split out shared files.
    This allows other programs (like gnome-control-center) to consume the
    settings schema without having to depend on the daemon itself.

  [ Rasmus Thomsen ]
  * fbd-feedback-profile: use G_GSIZE_FORMAT instead of hardcoding lu.
    On 32-bit platforms lu doesn't apply since GType is defined as a gsize
    fixes #15
