  * libfeedback: Drop trailing semicolon.
    Trips up some compilers.
    Thanks to Andrea Schaefer
  * build: Don't add lfb-enums.c to list of generated sources.
    Otherwise when used as a subproject the master project will try
    to rebuild with it's own set of flags. These lack
    LIBFEEDBACK_COMPILATION which does not end well.
  * Fix typos
  * theme: Add timeout-completed event for alarms and stop watches
  * Update docs (Closes: #4, #8)
  * debian: Split out shared files.
    This allows other programs (like gnome-control-center) to consume the
    settings schema without having to depend on the daemon itself.

  [ Rasmus Thomsen ]
  * fbd-feedback-profile: use G_GSIZE_FORMAT instead of hardcoding lu.
    On 32-bit platforms lu doesn't apply since GType is defined as a gsize
    fixes #15
