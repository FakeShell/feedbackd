feedbackd (0.0.0+git20210125) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Dylan Van Assche ]
  * meson.build: compile GLib schemas on install.
    Run a script as a post install to make sure that all GLib schemas are compiled
  * fbd-feedback-manager: Allow device-specific feedbackd themes.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * feedback-manager: Fix formatting.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * sound: Set 'event' media role.  This allows pa to cork, duck, etc.
  * gitlab-ci: Honor PKG_ONLY.  This allow us to get debs quicker
  * udev: Update led maching for the librem5.  The names changed in device
    tree which tickles up into userspace.
  * debian: Don't abuse the video group.  Use a separate group for users that
    should be able to access the LED devices.

  [ Luca Weiss ]
  * fbd-dev-leds: fix brightness parameter.
    The fbd_dev_led_set_brightness function is only getting called with
    parameter 0 at the moment so this was never noticed.
  * Fix typos

feedbackd (0.0.0+git20200726) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * debian: udev: add support for PinePhone front LEDs
  * fbd-dev-leds: store LED color when parsing devices.
    Failing to do so will always select the first recognized LED (the blue 
    one for the PinePhone).

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Release new git snapshot
  * fbd-dev-sound: Be less verbose on missing sound files.
    This is quite common so don't fill the logs at normal debug levels
    but be more specific about what is missing.
  * fbd-feedback-base: Add fbd_feedback_is_available ()
    This allows to check if a feedback type is available
    at all.
  * feedback-manager: Fix indentation
  * fbd-feedback-manager: Check if feedback is usable.
    If we don't find any usable feedbacks for an event return
    FBD_EVENT_END_REASON_NOT_FOUND.
  * fbd-feedback-led: Implement is_available ()
    This avoids criticals when there's no Leds available.
  * feedback-vibra-rumble: Implement is_available.
    This avoids criticals when there's no rumble vibra available.
  * feedback-vibra-periodic: Implement is_available.
    This avoids criticals when there's no periodic vibra available.
  * feedback-sound: Implement is_available.
    This avoids criticals when there's sound device available. We
    can also be more precise about the reason why feedback ended.
  * feedback-theme: Avoid warning when feedback is not found.
    We tell the caller so debug level is enough
  * tests: Don't check end reason in feedback handler.
    This allows to reuse the feedback handler and we check the
    reason in the actual test function anyway.
  * tests: Test event not found case too
  * feedback-manager: Deeply free the feedback list.
    Instead of freeing each element after each iteration and then the list
    itself at the very end just fully free the list. g_autoslist does
    not work well on oder glib so do that manually.
    This is just cosmetics.
  * feedback-manager: Don't forget to remove not found events from the hash table.
    This plugs a leak.
  * feedback-manager: Dispose leds too
  * feedback-led: Stop the correct led color
  * feedback-led: Don't try to stop led when there's no led device.
    This is not a critical since we prevented submitting initially
    but daemon cleanup processes all entries in the theme.
  * fbd: Dispose manager at the very end

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * doc: fix typos
  * doc: feedbackd: add short description.
    Lintian issues a warning if short description is empty.
  * fbd-ledctrl: fix typo

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * lfb-event: Clarify return values of `finished` functions.
    They just inidicate that we talked to feedbackd successfully.
  * lfb-event: Connect done handler in async case too.
    Otherwise the event state is not updated properly
  * tests: Don't quit mainloop on event end.
    This is needed to properly test aync where we have the
    finished async event handler and the signal.
  * tests: Use async feedback as the test name implies

feedbackd (0.0.0+git20200707) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * data: Lower rumble time for window-close and button-pressed even more.
    Haptic feedback for touchscreen input should be as subtle as possible
    to not make it distracting.
  * data: Add button-released event

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * feedback-sound: Plug a leak.
    We did not free the effect name
  * Doc cleanups
  * feedback-manager: Only act on add.
    We would otherwise ignore the action when no vibra device was yet found.
    Make sure we release the old device when updating.
  * libfeedback: Unset _initted early.
    This make sure a client does not end up in our shutdown phase and sees a
    half initted library.
  * libfeedback: Cancel all running feedbacks on uninit.
    We keep track of the active ids and end them on uninit. This
    make sure feedbacks don't continue to run if the application quits
    and forgets to end a feedback.
  * fbcli: Quit main loop on CTRL-C / SIGTERM.
    This makes sure we invoke the cleanup function correctly and allows
    to test running event handling.
  * docs: Add manpages (Closes: #12)
  * data: Drop phone-missed-call in 'quiet' profile.  Only want LEDs there.
  * feedbackd: Add helper to set up permissions for LEDs.
    This helper knows about the triggers and necessary permission.
    It's intended to be run via udev.
  * debian: Setup leds via udev.
    This allows feedbackd to set periodic feedback and makes usable
    LED devices identifiable by feedbackd.
  * feedbackd: Support visual feedback via LEDs.
    later on by using the 'repeat' attribute of the LED pattern
    trigger.
  * data: Use LED feedback for missed calls, IMs and SMS
  * Add generic missed notification.
    This can be used e.g. by the shell for general purpose notifictions
    but also for in app notifications of the foreground app.
  * feedback-manager: Add hint to select feedback profile per event.
    This e.g. allows events that are meant for haptic only to avoid
    emitting a sound by omitting the 'full' level and using "quiet"
    instead. (Closes: #7)
  * LfbEvent: Add feedback-profile property.
    This allows to specify the feedback profile to use for
    this particular event.
  * cli: Allow to set profile per event.
    We allowed set the global profile via `-P` use it as per event
    profile when used with `-E`.

  * build: Remove feedback dependencies from libfeedback builds

  [ Rasmus Thomsen ]
  * build: add proper dependencies on gdbus-codgen-generated headers.
    Without this it was possible that ninja built a target that needs
    the generated header before the header was generated

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Release another git snapshot
  * Honor sound theme on GNOME.
    We don't set this for other DEs since they might want to pick a good
    default from elsewhere.

feedbackd (0.0.0+git20200420) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Release another git snapshot
  * Add symbols file
  * theme: order feedbacks alphabetically.
  * theme: Add feedbacks for window-close and button-press
  * Allow to lower the feedback level per application.

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * d/control: customize short descriptions per binary package
  * d/control: change feedbackd-common architecture to 'all'
  * debian: rename gir package to match typelib name

feedbackd (0.0.0+git20200305) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  * feedbackd-common: Add proper Breaks/Replaces.
    This handles partial upgrades with newer schema but old feebackd.

feedbackd (0.0.0+git20200304) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * libfeedback: Drop trailing semicolon.
    Trips up some compilers.
    Thanks to Andrea Schaefer
  * build: Don't add lfb-enums.c to list of generated sources.
    Otherwise when used as a subproject the master project will try
    to rebuild with it's own set of flags. These lack
    LIBFEEDBACK_COMPILATION which does not end well.
  * Fix typos
  * theme: Add timeout-completed event for alarms and stop watches
  * Update docs (Closes: #4, #8)
  * debian: Split out shared files.
    This allows other programs (like gnome-control-center) to consume the
    settings schema without having to depend on the daemon itself.

  [ Rasmus Thomsen ]
  * fbd-feedback-profile: use G_GSIZE_FORMAT instead of hardcoding lu.
    On 32-bit platforms lu doesn't apply since GType is defined as a gsize
    fixes #15
